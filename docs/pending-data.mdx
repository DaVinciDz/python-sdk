# Pending data

The Python SDK supports [indexing pending data](/docs/pending-data) to implement
_optimistic updates_ in your application.

Adding support for pending blocks to your application is easy, simply specify 
finality equal to `DataFinality.DATA_STATUS_PENDING`.

If you're using the `Indexer` abstraction, implement the `handle_pending_data`
method. This method is called every time the stream receives pending data.

## Chain-aware storage

The chain-aware storage provided by the Python SDK will handle data
invalidation for you:

 - On every new pending data, it invalidates all data from the previously
 handled pending block.
 - On new data blocks, it invalidates any pending data.


## Best practices

 - Add an attribute to documents to track wether the document was inserted in an
 accepted block or in a pending block. Use this information to clearly display
 data in your application.
