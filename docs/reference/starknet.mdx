# `apibara.starknet`

This module provides helpers to build StarkNet data filters and to decode StarkNet block data.

## Cursor

The SDK provides an helper function to create StarkNet-specific cursors.

Cursors contains an _"order key"_ and a _"unique key"_. Order keys represent
block numbers and are used to order blocks of data. Since, because of chain
reorganizations, it's possible to have multiple blocks with the same number,
cursors include a block's hash as unique key to uniquely identify a block.

```py
from apibara.starknet.cursor import starknet_cursor

# simple cursor
cursor = starknet_cursor(18_000)

# cursor with block hash included
cursor = starknet_cursor(18_000, "0x0534...f04a")
```

## FieldElement

The Apibara stream encodes StarkNet field elements (also known as felts) into 4
uint64 numbers. The SDK provides helper functions to convert from this
representation into Python's `int` or `str`.

```py
from apibara.starknet import felt

# converts felt to hex
felt.to_hex(my_felt)
# converts felt to int
felt.to_int(my_felt)

# converts from hex to felt
felt.from_hex("0x0534...123f")
# converts from int to felt
felt.from_int(1234)
```


## Filter

Class to build data filters. You can find more about filters in the [StarkNet section](/docs/starknet#filter).

```py
from apibara.starknet import Filter

filter = Filter().with_header()
```

```py
class Filter:
    def __init__(self):
        ...

    def encode(self) -> bytes:
        """Encodes the filter to bytes."""

    def with_header(self, weak: Optional[bool] = None) -> Filter:
        """
        Include header in the returned data.

        Set `weak = True` to include block headers only if any other
        filter matches.
        """

    def add_transaction(self, tx: TransactionFilter) -> Filter:
        """
        Include transaction data.
        
        Use an empty filter to return all transactions.
        """

    def add_event(self, ev: EventFilter) -> Filter:
        """
        Include event data.
        
        Use an empty filter to include all events.
        """

    def add_message(self, msg: MessageFilter) -> Filter:
        """
        Include messages from L2 to L1.
        
        Use an empty filter to include all messages.
        """

    def with_state_update(self, state_update: StateUpdateFilter) -> Filter:
        """
        Include state updates.
        """
```

### TransactionFilter

```py
# This filter matches any transaction.
Filter().add_transaction(TransactionFilter.any())

# This filter matches all deploy transactions
Filter().add_transaction(TransactionFilter.deploy())
```

## Block
